# 🚀 What is TitanML?

TitanML is a **zero-dependency, physics-powered AI knowledge graph engine**.

Instead of reading AI topics linearly, TitanML lets you:

- 🌌 Explore AI concepts visually  
- 🔗 Understand relationships between models and methods  
- 🧠 Navigate Artificial Intelligence as a connected ecosystem  
- ⚡ Interact with a real-time force simulation  

No frameworks.  
No libraries.  
Just engineering.

 

# ✨ Core Features

## ⚛️ Force-Directed Graph Engine
Custom-built physics simulation for natural node positioning.

- Attraction & repulsion forces  
- Organic layout behaviour  
- Smooth transitions  
- Real-time simulation  

 

## 🎨 God Mode Canvas Rendering
High-performance **HTML5 Canvas engine** featuring:

- Directional relationship arrows  
- Category-based gradient colouring  
- HiDPI / Retina optimisation  
- Animated link flows  
- Smooth zoom & drag  

 

## 🧩 Extensible Knowledge Architecture
Add new AI concepts instantly via a simple data object.

No need to modify rendering logic.

 

## 🔗 Deep Linking
Each node is directly addressable:

```

#rag
#transformers
#llm

```

Perfect for sharing specific AI concepts.

 

## 🧭 Navigation History
Full browser history support within the SPA:

- Back / Forward navigation  
- URL state persistence  
- Shareable graph positions  

 

## 📱 Responsive & Accessible
Modern glassmorphism UI designed for:

- Desktop  
- Tablet  
- Mobile  

Keyboard-first navigation is supported.

 

# 🏗 Architecture

TitanML follows a modular separation of concerns.

### Design Philosophy

- Single Responsibility per module  
- No framework lock-in  
- Maximum performance  
- Educational clarity  

 

# ⚡ Quick Start

No installation required.

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiverse01/titanML.git
cd titanML
````

## 2️⃣ Open the app

Simply open:

```
index.html
```

Or serve locally:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

 

# 🧠 Adding New AI Concepts

All knowledge is stored in:

```
js/data.js
```

Example:

```javascript
{
    id: "quantum-ml",
    name: "Quantum ML",
    category: "training",
    definition: "Machine learning methods applied to quantum computing systems.",
    related: ["transformers", "llm"]
}
```

That’s it.

The engine automatically renders:

* The node
* Its connections
* Its physics interactions

 

# 🎯 Roadmap
